## Sprint 1 Week 2


Sprint-2-Week-2
===================
Requirements | Evidence |
----------- | ----------- |
Scrum Master. Define tasks and place assignments to in-progress on the Scrum board.  | [Scrum Board](https://github.com/MadCActi/flask_portfolio/projects/1) |
Designer. Wire Frame (at least three theme pages, team mini-labs, and about) | https://www.figma.com/file/AFfWCkefwQGT4O1QuhZxUs/Wire-Frame |
Technical Lead. Coordinate brain write session, after preliminary wire frames, make sure you capture technical complexities as an output of this exercise (input, saving data, comments, visual actions, animations, ...) | An idea is a forum for current events with multiple subcategories for people to talk in different places.
Navigators. Capture or build highlight of Ideation in README.md, this allows ideas to persist with Project,  Make sure that work from Developers works to expectations (testing, suggestions for improvement) | Use Vanta for backgrounds                                                                                                                        Show photos of protfolio |
Developers. Bootstrap drop downs in navbar, start to form Wire Frame menu options.  Each menu option should have a Stub code page | image to be added|
Developers. Integration of Greet like functionality into a mini-lab page | Added to each individual page ![image]to be added |
Developers. Integration of Video Journal 0 into a mini-lab page | [Video Journal 0 embedded into portfolio](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLq5N5__AYvxqlz5qP-F1AlRSlRIz2eByY)


Sprint-3-Week-3
===================
Requirements | Evidence |
----------- | ----------- |
Note: | Raiden was absent this week, therefore will need to do some team catchup. He will add the minute update journal when done.
Review binary | Binary Numbers: What are they and how they can be used in the real world in computers and programs|



Sprint 3 Week 4
==================
Requirements | Evidence |
----------- | ----------- |
Scrum Master. Continue planning best practice, be prepared for review during class on Wednesday, for points  | [Scrum Board](https://github.com/MadCActi/flask_portfolio/projects/1) |
Designer. Ensure there is a Design or Research asset for prototyping work. | https://www.figma.com/file/AFfWCkefwQGT4O1QuhZxUs/Wire-Frame |
Navigators. Build a video showing design and runtime of prototype(s). | Video link to be added
Developers. Ensure each person has Prototype and/or TT3 hack coding task.  TT3 Binary Math must be included in project with all "Hack" suggestions.  Duplicating a Hack task for multiple individuals and integrating into their personal page(s), would be wise for someone who is behind on code commits. Everyone needs code commits. | Some of the Binary hack codings were done and the tasks were completed. Although it only shows as one person editing, we all collaboratively worked on it to understand how to get them to work and why.
